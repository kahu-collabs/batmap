Git rules for the bat cave

1. name your branches with train case, with the ticket number (waffle), feature name, and the language you're writing for this feature
2. don't push to master. Ever.
3. when you want to make a pull request, ask another member of the team to handle the merge
4. gitmaster is assigned daily. Gitmaster's responsibility is to keep an eye of gitflow and make sure everyone is keeping good git practice.
